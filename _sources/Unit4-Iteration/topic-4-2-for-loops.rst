For Loops
=========

..	index::
	single: for loop
	pair: loop; for


Another type of loop in Java is a **for loop**. This is usually used when you know how many times you want the loop to execute. It is often a simple **counter-controlled loop** to do the loop body a set number of times.

If you took AP CSP with a block programming language like App Inventor, you probably used a for loop block like below that looks very similar to Java for loops. If you have used a language like Scratch or Snap!, you may remember the repeat(n) block where you type in a number of times you want the code to be repeated, just like the AP pseudocode REPEAT block. In fact, almost every programming language has a for or repeat loop.

    Figure 1: Comparing App Inventor and Java for loops

A for-loop has 3 parts: initialization, condition, and change.  The parts are separated by semicolons (``;``).  Each of the three parts of a ``for`` loop declaration is optional (initialization, condition, and change), but the semicolons are not optional.  Note that these 3 parts correspond to the the 3 steps of writing a loop mentioned in the last lesson: initialize, test, and change the loop variable. In for loops, the loop variable is usually a counter variable.

.. code-block:: java

  for (initialization; condition; change)
  {
     loop body
  }
  
The for-loop is almost a shortcut way to write a while loop with all three steps that you need in one line. One of the strange things about a ``for`` loop is that the code doesn't actually execute where you see it in the declaration.  The code in the initialization area is executed only one time before the loop begins, the condition is checked each time through the loop and the loop continues as long as the condition is true, at the end of each execution of the body of the loop the changes are done, just like a while loop.  When the loop condition is false execution will continue at the next statement after the body of the loop.

You can compare a ``while`` loop to a ``for`` loop to understand that a ``for`` loop actually executes like a ``while`` loop does if you use the ``while`` loop to repeat the body of the loop a specific number of times.

   :feedback_a: This loop starts with i equal to 3 but ends when i is equal to 8.  
   :feedback_b: What is i set to in the initialization area?
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the for loop was missing the change part <code>(int i = 3; i < 8; )</code> but it does increment i in the change part <code>(int i = 3; i < 8; i++)</code>.
   :feedback_d: The value of i is set to 3 before the loop executes and the loop stops when i is equal to 8.  So the last time through the loop i is equal to 7.  

   What does the following code print?
   
   .. code-block:: java

   What does the following code print?

   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if i started at 0 and ended at 9.  Does it?
   :feedback_b: Since i starts at 3 and the last time through the loop it is 9 the loop executes 7 times (9 - 3 + 1 = 7)
   :feedback_c: How many numbers are between 3 and 9 (including 3 and 9)?   
   :feedback_d: This would be true if i started at 0 and the value of i the last time through the loop it was 8.   

   How many times does the following method print a ``*``?

   The following method has the correct code to print out all the even values from 0 to the value of 10, but the code is mixed up.  Drag the blocks from the left into the correct order on the right and indent them correctly.  Even though Java doesn't require indention it is a good habit to get into. You will be told if any of the blocks are in the wrong order or not indented correctly when you click the "Check Me" button.

   What do you think will happen when you run the code below?  How would it change if you changed line 11 to initialize i's value to 3?
   ~~~~
   public class SongTest
   {

      public static void printPopSong()
      {
         String line1 = " bottles of pop on the wall";
         String line2 = " bottles of pop";  
         String line3 = "Take one down and pass it around";  
  
         // loop 5 times (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         SongTest.printPopSong();
      }
   }
  
The method **printPopSong** prints the words to a song.  It initializes the value of the variable i equal to 5 and then checks if i is greater than 0.  Since 5 is greater than 0, the body of the loop executes.  Before the condition is checked again, i is decreased by 1.  When the value in i is equal to 0 the loop stops executing.

         String line2 = " bottles of pop";  
         String line3 = "Take one down and pass it around";

      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         SongTest.printPopSong();
      }
   }
   
.. How many times does the code above print the lines to the song?
   
.. .. note::
   
   You can also calculate the number of times a loop executes as the value that ends the loop minus the starting value.  In this case the loop ends when i is 3 so (3 - 0 = 3).  


.. note::
   
   Two common patterns in for-loops are to count from 0 up to an number (using <) or count from 1 to the number including the number (using <=). Remember that if you start at 0 use <, and if you start at 1, use <=. The two loops below using these two patterns both run 10 times. The variable i (for index) is often used as a counter in for-loops.
   
   .. code-block:: java 
   
      // These loops both run 10 times
      // If you start at 0, use <
      for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)   
         System.out.println(i);
      // If you start at 1, use <=
      for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)  
         System.out.println(i);
        
        
|CodingEx| **Coding Exercise**

Do you remember when we used the turtle objects to draw shapes? To create a square without loops we had to repeat code to go forward and turn 90 degrees to the right 4 times like below. Can you change the code below to remove the repeated lines of code and use a loop to draw 4 sides of the square? Did you notice that the code becomes a lot shorter? You should only need 1 forward and 1 turn command in the loop. Whenever you find yourself repeating code, try to use a loop instead!

(If the code below does not work for you, you can copy the code into  this |repl link| (refresh page after forking and if it gets stuck) or download the files |github| to use in your own IDE.)

In the last exercise, you used a for-loop to have the turtle draw a square. Use the Active Code window below or this |repl link| to have yertle draw the following shapes using loops. We encourage you to work in pairs.

1. Have yertle draw an equilateral triangle using a loop. How many times should the loop run? Remember that it ran 4 times for a square, so how many for a triangle? What angle should you use for the turns? One way to figure this out is to notice that to complete a shape, all the exterior angles should add up to 360 degrees. So, for a square 4x90 = 360. 

2. Have yertle draw a pentagon using a loop. A pentagon has 5 sides. What angle should you use for the turns? Remember they have to add up to 360 degrees.

3. Create a variable n that holds the number of sides for any polygon, and use n in your loop. Can you have the loop draw a variety of shapes by just changing the value of the variable n? The power of abstraction! Can you draw a 9 sided nonagon? (Note that if the turtle runs into walls, it stays there and will mess up the shape, so you may have to move the turtle or go forward smaller amounts).

          Turtle yertle = new Turtle(world);
          yertle.penUp();  // move a little to the left
          yertle.moveTo(100,200);
          yertle.penDown();

Summary
-------

- There are three parts in a for loop header: the initialization, the Boolean expression, and the increment or decrement statement.

- In a for loop, the initialization statement is only executed once before the first Boolean expression evaluation. The variable being initialized is referred to as a **loop control variable**.

- In each iteration of a for loop, the increment statement is executed after the entire loop body is executed and before the Boolean expression is evaluated again.

- A for loop can be rewritten into an equivalent while loop and vice versa.
